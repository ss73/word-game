# Word game written in Python

This is an implementation of the popular game commonly known as _Wordle_. 
The game is played in the console. There is a Swedish and an English dictionary
available and it comes with a tool to add additional dictionaries for more languages

The game was developed as an optional assignment in the course 
[1NX002](https://www.umu.se/en/education/syllabus/1nx002/) given at Ume√• University 

## Example gameplay

The snippet below shows the output of a game session, including game instructions that
are printed when the game is started
```
Welcome to the game of wordle!
I am thinking of a five-letter word.
You have 6 tries to guess the word.
After each guess, you will receive feedback on the correctness of the letters.
The feedback is given as follows:
 *X*  - correct letter in the correct position
 (X)  - correct letter, but in the wrong position
  X   - incorrect letter

Good luck!

## How to install and run the game

You need a [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter (v.3.9 or higher) to run the game, that's all.
Assuming you have installed Python, follow these steps to install and run the program:
* Clone the repository into a directory of choice (or download zip)
* Optionally - if you want to use another dictionary
  * Download a dic file for your language [here](https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries)
  * Place the dic file in the `res` folder and rename it `raw_<lang code>.txt`
  * Create a file called `chars_<lang_code>.txt`containing a single line with the allowed characters for the language
  * Run `python tools/process_dict.py <lang code>`
* Run the game: `python main.py [lang code]`
* If lang code is omitted, the default language of Swedish (sv) will be used
